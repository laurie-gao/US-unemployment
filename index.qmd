# Introduction

The topic we chose to study is unemployment rate in the US. In particular, we are going to examine the trend of unemployment rate in recent years and characteristics of the unemployed (sex, race, age, marital status, etc.). We chose this topic because it is relevant to many of us who are currently working, applying to jobs, or soon entering the job market. Moreover, with inflation slowing down and recent rapid advancements in AI, we are interested in seeing how the job market is responding. Through our studies, we hope to answer the following questions:

1. What is the general US unemployment rate trend over recent years?
2. Were there any significant fluctuations in unemployment rate and what are possible explanations for those fluctuations?
3. Are there any noticeable correlations between sex, race, age group, etc. with unemployment rate?
4. What is trend of the unemployment rate for different sex, race, age groups, etc. over recent years?

For those unfamiliar with the topic, a country's unemployment rate is the percentage of the country's total labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. The unemployment rate, along with many other indicators, can provide insight into how an economy is performing. In this study, we will also be examining the unemployment rate of particular groups to see if there is a significant difference in unemployment rate between different groups.
