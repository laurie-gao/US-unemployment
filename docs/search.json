    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic we chose to study is unemployment rate in the US. In particular, we are going to examine the trend of unemployment rate in recent years and characteristics of the unemployed (sex, race, age, marital status, etc.). We chose this topic because it is relevant to many of us who are currently working, applying to jobs, or soon entering the job market. Moreover, with inflation slowing down and recent rapid advancements in AI, we are interested in seeing how the job market is responding. Through our studies, we hope to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the general US unemployment rate trend over recent years?\nWere there any significant fluctuations in unemployment rate and what are possible explanations for those fluctuations?\nAre there any noticeable correlations between sex, race, age group, etc. with unemployment rate?\nWhat is trend of the unemployment rate for different sex, race, age groups, etc. over recent years?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the topic, a country’s unemployment rate is the percentage of the country’s total labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. The unemployment rate, along with many other indicators, can provide insight into how an economy is performing. In this study, we will also be examining the unemployment rate of particular groups to see if there is a significant difference in unemployment rate between different groups."

The data is collected through the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are many CPS tables on the linked website - the specific tables we will be using for our study are listed below.\n\nA-10. Unemployment rates by age, sex, and marital status, seasonally adjusted (monthly, seasonally adjusted)\n\nTime range: Oct 2022 - Oct 2023\nFrequency of update: monthly - the most recent update was for Oct 2023\nDimensions: month, age group, sex, marital status\n\nA-29.

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nEach of the tables above contains different time ranges, frequency of update, and dimensions, so we will be combining the information drawn from them to answer our research questions.\n\nWhat is the general US unemployment rate trend over recent years?\nWe can answer this by calculating the average unemployment rate of all the groups in table E-7 for each quarter to see the quarterly trend over time from 2020 to 2023. We can also perform similar calculations for the other tables and plot the average unemployment rate against time to see if there are any monthly or yearly trends.\nWere there any significant fluctuations in unemployment rate and what are possible explanations for those fluctuations?\nTo answer this question, we can use the same plots from question 1 and study by inspection to see if there are any noticeable dips or hikes in unemployment rate from month to month or quarter to quarter.\nAre there any noticeable correlations between sex, race, age group, etc. with unemployment rate?\n\n\nmosaic plots\nfacets\nparallel coordinate plots\n\n\nWhat is trend of the unemployment rate for different sex, race, age groups, etc. over recent years?\n\n\nseparate plot for each group"
