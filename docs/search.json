    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic we chose to study is unemployment rate in the US and the factors influencing it including the recent pandemic and the stock market. In particular, we are going to examine the trend of unemployment rate in recent years (2020 - 2023) along with different characteristics of the unemployed (sex, race, age, marital status, etc.). Furthermore, we will be using the S&P 500 index as our indicator for guaging the general performance of the stock market. We chose this topic because it is relevant to many of us who are currently working, applying to jobs, or soon entering the job market. Moreover, we are interested in seeing how the unemployment rate has changed since the initial onset of COVID-19 in 2020 and whether the impact of the pandemic on employment has been different for different sex, race, age, and marital status groups. In addition to national unemployment rate, we are interested in examining the unemployment rate for individual states in the US and whether there is a correlation between that and the severity of COVID-19’s impact on the state. Through our studies, we hope to answer the following research questions:\n\nWhat are the similarities and differences in trends between COVID-19 death rates, the S&P 500 index, and the unemployment rates?\nHow does the unemployment rate differ for different race, sex, age, and marital groups?\nWhat are the similarities and differences in trends between COVID-19 death rates and the unemployment rates across people of different sex or people with different ethnicity?\nWhat is the potential effects of race and age on the trend of unemployment rate during COVID-19 pandemic?\nWhat is the potential effects of marital status and sex on the trend of unemployment rate during COVID-19 pandemic?\nWhich racial group has the most serious unemployment issue during the peak of the national unemployment rate (Apr 2020) vs April 2023 given age and sex?\nWhich state faced the most severe unemployment issue during the peak of the national unemployment rate (April 2020)?\nWhich state faced the most severe pandemic-related death issue during the peak of the national COVID death rate (January 2021)?\n\nA country’s unemployment rate is the percentage of the country’s total labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. It is important to note that individuals not seeking employment will not be taken into consideration, so if a particular group of people have low job demand, the group will likely have a low unemployment rate. The unemployment rate, along with many other indicators, can provide insight into how an economy is performing."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\n\n2.1.1 1. Monthly US National Unemployment Rate Data\nData Source\nAll of the national unemployment rate data will be from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data is collected through the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are many CPS tables on the website - we want our data to be similar to A-10. Unemployment rates by age, sex, and marital status, seasonally adjusted, which allows us to investigate potential influences of ethnicity, age, sex, and even marital status on unemployment rate.\nData Import\nAs BLS doesn’t provide CSV files of such organized data like the A-10 table, we access the raw data by The BLS Public Data Application Programming Interface (API). Specifically, we use API to extract national unemployment rates of different demographic groups. When extracting data, we refer to LN series id list – Labor force statistics including the national unemployment rate (we save it as ln.series.txt in the data folder for further use) under CPS Databases and put the series_id of the information we need into the api query (ie. we extract some of the data listed here by API). We then convert all the data from Json to CSV files, preprocess the data, and combine them into single data set.\nThe data set is in the following format:\n\nTime range: Jan 2020 - Nov 2023\nFrequency of update: monthly - latest update is for Nov 2023\nDimensions: year, month, value, adjusted, sex, race, age, mari\n\nyear: the year of the unemployment rate survey\nmonth: the month of the unemployment rate survey\nvalue: unemployment rate\nadjusted: whether the unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted\nsex: the sex surveyed for the unemployment rate (can take value “Both”, “Men”, or “Women”)\nrace: the race surveyed for the unemployment rate (can take value “All”, “Asian”, “Black”, “Latino”, or “White”)\nage: the age surveyed for the unemployment rate (can take value “All”, “16-19”, “20-24”, “25-34”, “35-44”, “45-54”, “55-64”, or “65-” for unadjusted data; “16-17”, “16-19”, “16-24”, “18-19”, “20-”, “20-24”, “25-”, “25-34”, “25-54”, “35-44”, “45-54”, or “55-” for seasonally adjusted data)\nmari: the marital status surveyed for the unemployment rate (can take value “All”, “Never Married”, “Married, spouse present”, or “Widdowed, divorced, or seperated” for unadjusted data; “All” or “Married, spouse present” for seasonally adjusted data)\nNote that BLS does not collect unemployment rate for all combinations of all demographic features! (For example, unadjusted unemployment rate data for 20-to-24-year-old asian men, whose marital status is “Widdowed, divorced, or seperated” doesn’t exist.)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(warning

Plot grouped bar chart of different races across sex with facets on marital status and year. Also create a grouped bar chart of different age groups across sex with a facet on year.\nWhat are the similarities and differences in trends between COVID-19 death rates and the unemployment rates across people of different sex or people with different ethnicity?\nCreate line plots for Monthly US National Unemployment Rate Data and Monthly US National COVID-19 Death Rate Data with facets on different demographic groups (e.g. black, women, and etc.) and types of rate (unemployment rate or COVID-19 death rate).\nWhat is the potential effects of race and age on the trend of unemployment rate during COVID-19 pandemic?\nCreate line plots for Monthly US National Unemployment Rate Data with a facet on combinations of races and age groups.\nWhat is the potential effects of marital status and sex on the trend of unemployment rate during COVID-19 pandemic?\nCreate line plots for Monthly US National Unemployment Rate Data across sex with a facet on marital statuses.\nWhich racial group has the most serious unemployment issue during the peak of the national unemployment rate (Apr 2020) vs April 2023 given age and sex?\nCreate two heat maps (one for Apr 2020, and the other for April 2023). Each uses the age group as the x-axis and race as the y-axis. It is filled with “the unemployment rate of people who belong to a specific age group and race” divided by “the sum of unemployment rates of people of all the races in the same age group.”\nWhich state faced the most severe unemployment issue during the peak of the national unemployment rate (April 2020) and how does it compare to the state’s COVID deaths severity at the same time?\nPlot state choropleth using Monthly US State Unemployment Rate Data, Monthly US States COVID-19 Death Data, and State Population Data. Use Monthly US State Unemployment Rate Data to show unemployment severity of states in April 2020. Use Monthly US States COVID-19 Death Data and State Population Data to calculate monthly US states COVID-19 death rates and show that of states in April 2020.\nWhich state faced the most severe pandemic-related death issue during the peak of the national COVID death rate (January 2021) and how does it compare to the state’s unemployment severity at the same time?\nPlot state choropleth using Monthly US State Unemployment Rate Data, Monthly US States COVID-19 Death Data, and State Population Data.

In contrast, the unemployment rate surged in the middle of 2020, coinciding with the first peak in mortality rate, but then gradually declined and stabilized, showing no significant impact from the second and third waves of the pandemic. As for the S&P 500, it also experienced a sharp decline during the first peak in mortality rate but continued to grow afterward, with no apparent influence from the subsequent waves of the pandemic. It’s worth noting that in 2022, following the easing of the pandemic, the S&P 500 actually went through a period of decline, possibly due to factors unrelated to the pandemic. In summary, the chart indicates a strong negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the S&P 500, with both being notably affected by the first wave of the pandemic. However, this impact did not persist into the second or third peak periods of the pandemic, as economic conditions gradually improved and stabilized after the initial shock of the first wave."

For single Blacks, Latinos, and Whites, the unemployment rate for women is slightly lower than for the men. Interestingly, for single Asians, the unemployment rate for women is significantly lower than for men. However, the opposite is true for divorced Asians; the unemployment rate for divorced Asian women is more than twice as high as the unemployment rate for divorced Asian men. Meanwhile, for the other races in the same category, the disparity between men and women is much smaller. Furthermore, we can observe that the unemployment rate for married individuals in general is noticeably lower compared to to the other marital statuses.\nCompared to the year 2020, which was the year with the most severe unemployment situation, it can be observed that in 2023, regardless of marital status, male unemployment rates are worse than those of females, irrespective of the race. However, in 2020, this was the case only for Black individuals, as other races generally had higher female unemployment rates. Particularly, for married women, the difference in unemployment rates between females and males was much more unfavorable in 2020 compared to 2023. For individuals who have never been married, in 2023, male unemployment rates are worse than those of females across all races, while in 2020, this pattern was significant only among Black individuals. For individuals who are widowed, divorced, or separated, Asian males had significantly better unemployment rates than Asian females in 2023, whereas in 2020, both genders had similar rates.\n\n\nCode\nUR_202023_sex_age = UR %&gt;% filter(year == 2023|year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  filter(adjusted==FALSE, sex != \"Both\", age != \"All\", race == \"All\", mari == \"All\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(sex, age, year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(age = paste(age, \"yo\"))%&gt;%\n  summarise(avg = mean(value)) %&gt;%\n  rename(unemployment_rate=avg)\n\nggplot(UR_202023_sex_age, aes(x=age, y=unemployment_rate, fill=sex)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") + \n  labs(title = \"Figure 3 Unemployment Rate by Age and Sex in 2020 and 2023\") +\n  ylab(\"Unemployment Rate (%)\")+\n  facet_grid(year~.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 examines on the average unemployment rate in 2023 for different age groups and sex. As expected, the unemployment rate is highest for youths in the 16-19 year old group and gradually decreases as age increases. The 35-44 year old age groups and older age groups have around the same unemployment rate of under 3%. In general, women have a lower unemployment rate than men and the difference is greater for the younger age groups.\nCompared to the situation in 2023, it can be observed that in 2020, there was no scenario where ‘male unemployment rates, regardless of age group, were worse than females.’ Specifically, in 2020, except for the 16-19 age group, female unemployment rates were worse than those of males. This trend was particularly pronounced among older age groups."

Similarly, the unemployment rate exhibits a right-skewed pattern, indicating a rapid increase during the first peak of the pandemic, followed by a gradual decline and stabilization. Furthermore, we can observe that, overall, Asians have lower death rates compared to other racial groups, and females have slightly lower death rates than males. Regarding the unemployment rate, Whites have lower rates compared to other racial groups, and males have slightly lower rates than females. This demonstrates that the relationship between the unemployment rate and the death rate is relative rather than absolute. It suggests that an increase in the death rate often coincides with an increase in the unemployment rate, but it doesn’t imply that higher absolute death rates lead to higher absolute unemployment rates."

Across all racial groups, it can be observed that relative to adults, both youth and seniors experienced more significant fluctuations in unemployment rates, especially among the youth. The volatility in unemployment rates among the youth did not dissipate after the first wave of the pandemic; in fact, it can be observed that during the second and third waves of the pandemic, the unemployment rate continued to rise. Additionally, irrespective of age, it is noticeable that the unemployment rate for White individuals exhibited less fluctuation compared to other racial groups, with their peak unemployment rates following a similar pattern. In summary, the findings from this chart align with our intuition: the middle-aged individuals who have already established stable foundations in the workplace experience less severe unemployment due to the pandemic’s impact. Furthermore, racial groups that generally hold higher socioeconomic status also tend to be less susceptible to pandemic-induced unemployment.\nNote: We really want to compare these trends with those of COVID-19 Death Rates, but we don’t have data to do so as the COVID-19 Death Rates data doesn’t contain data points for combinations of demographic features."

Among 55-64-year-old males, Asians face the most severe unemployment issues, and among males aged 65 and older, Asians also face the most severe unemployment issues. For females, we observe a similar pattern in unemployment by age and race, expect a few notable differences and a greater disparity in the unemployment rates between different groups. For example, there now appears to be a greater disparity between the Asian and White and the Black and Latino racial groups particularly in the 20-24, 25-34, and 35-44 age groups; the unemployment rate for the Asian and White groups are lower than the rate for Black and Latino groups and the difference is greater comapred to April 2020. Another notable change is in the unemployment rate of Asian females in the 45-54 and 55-64 age groups which declined significantly compared to April 2020, while the unemployment rate for Blacks in the same group increased. Latino females aged 65+ continues to face the most severe unemployment issues.\nOverall, there has been an increase in the disparity of unemployment rates across all age, sex, and racial groups in April 2023 compared to April 2020. In general, Whites and Asians tend to have the least severe unemployment issues among all racial groups."

Hawaii is an exception in this regard, as it experiences significant unemployment, but its COVID deaths severity is quite mild. This aligns with our intuition, as Hawaii heavily relies on the tourism industry. With the global border closures due to the pandemic, the tourism sector has suffered a severe blow, leading to a high unemployment rate in Hawaii. However, this situation is not directly related to the local severity of the pandemic but rather connected to global border policies adopted by various countries."

    "text": "In conclusion, we were able to derive insights from a combination of US unemployment rate data, COVID-19 death rate data, and the S&P 500 stock data to answer our research questions. Below is a summary of our key findings:\n\nCOVID-19 death rate in the US had three distinct spikes, occurring around mid 2020, early 2021, and late 2021. The first spike coincided with the spike in national unemployment rate, which has been decreasing ever since. The first spike also coincided with a dip in the S&P 500 stock index, but the stock market quickly recovered.\nIn general, unemployment rate is lower for Asian and White racial groups compared to Black and Latino racial groups. Women tend to have a lower unemployment rate than men, and youth and young adults have a high unemployment rate which decreases as age increases.\nAll race, age, and sex groups displayed the same trend when it comes to the spike in unemployment rate and COVID-19 death rate. There were three spikes in death rate with and the first spike coincided with the spike in unemployment rate.\nAlthough the unemployment rate has decreased significantly since its spike in 2020, data shows that that the rate has decreased more for Asian and White racial groups than for Black and Latino racial groups. There is a now a greater disparity in unemployment rate between the racial groups compared to 2020.\nThe US states that faced the most severe unemployment rate issues during the spike in April 2020 were Nevada, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Hawaii, and Rhode Island.\nThe US states that had the highest COVID-19 death rates during the peak in January 2021 where Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia.\n\nOverall, we observed that the unemployment rate has been recovering since its spike in 2020 and is decreasing for all age, sex, race, and marital status groups. As expected, COVID-19 had a significant impact on the US market and we are still feeling its effects to this day."
